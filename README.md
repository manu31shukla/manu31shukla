# Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a software developer with a passion for creating elegant and intuitive user interfaces. I specialize in using  MERN(MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack to build web applications that are both beautiful and functional.

 In addition to my front-end development skills, I am also proficient in C++ and have experience in data structures and algorithms. I believe that a strong foundation in computer science is essential for creating high-quality software that can scale and perform well.

## Skills
- MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)
- Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Designer (UI/UX, Figma)

On my GitHub account, you will find a collection of projects that showcase my skills in both development and design. Whether I am working on a complex web application or a simple UI prototype, I always strive to create software that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

## Featured Projects
Here are some of my notable projects that showcase my skills and expertise:
