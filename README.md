Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ I am a software developer with a passion for creating elegant and intuitive user interfaces. I specialize in using React.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build web applications that are both beautiful and functional.

In addition to my front-end development skills, I am also proficient in C++ and have experience in data structures and algorithms. I believe that a strong foundation in computer science is essential for creating high-quality software that can scale and perform well.
